### ChatGPT Usage Patterns

We identified three main modes of ChatGPT usage among students. Table below shows the distribution of different types of usage patterns across different processes: 𝐴+, 𝐴−, and 𝐵.

Each usage mode can be applied to one or more components of the requirements specification: use cases (UC), actors (AC), use case diagram (UCD), success/failure scenarios (SC), and non-functional requirements (NF). We further illustrate the distribution of these components for each usage pattern within each process.
