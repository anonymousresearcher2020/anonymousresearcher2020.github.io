### CPEN 321 - Requirement Engineering Milestone Summaries

The purpose of this document is to specify the information required from students to define the project proposal (section A) as well as the initial (section B) and final (section C) requirement specifications. 
—------------------------------—------------------------------—------------------------------—-------------------------------------
A.	Project Proposal Assignment: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	In this assignment, each group of four students is asked to come up with two different ideas that can be implemented during the course.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	Each idea must take into account the following project expectations:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○	Scope:  2-3 main actors and 5-6 non-trivial requirements
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○	Required features:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■	Use of an external authentication service, e.g., Google
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■	Use of at least one additional external service accessible via an API, e.g., Google calendar, Google maps, etc. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■	Real-time updates, e.g., multi-user chats, push notifications, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■	Complex logic in either front-end or back-end component (i.e., something that involves an algorithm, not a simple API call or database read/update/delete)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○	Implementation: Android Front-end using Java, Node.js backend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	Submission: A PDF file containing information about two project ideas.

B.	Initial Requirements Lab Activity:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	In this 2-hour long lab activity, each group of students works on the requirement specifications of one of their project ideas (P) randomly selected by a TA. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	Usage of assistive AI technology is strictly prohibited.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	As per the course material, a formal requirement specification is required containing: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○	A use-case diagram connecting actors to functional requirements
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○	A description of each actor (1-2 sentences). 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○	A list functional requirements specifying the name of the requirement, a short description, primary actor(s), success and failure scenarios, and mockups (optional).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○	A list of 2-3 non-functional requirements with an explanation of why this requirement is needed/relevant for the project and how it will be validated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	Submission: A scanned PDF file containing the formal specification in the format above.

C.	Final Requirement Specification Assignment:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	In this assignment each group of students is asked to submit a formal requirement specification for both of their project ideas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	Documented usage of AI technology (namely, ChatGPT 3.5)  is required.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	Each group uses the following workflow to generate the final requirements:
a.	For the idea a group worked on during the lab activity (P), they start from a possibly updated project specification from the lab (P_initial), and refine it with the assistance of ChatGPT to generate the final specification (P_final). 
b.	For the idea a group has not yet worked on (P’),  they start from the specification provided by ChatGPT and refine it to generate the final specification (P’_final).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●	Submissions: (1) A PDF file containing the formal requirement specifications P_initial, P_final, and P’_final. (2) HTML files containing ChatGPT conversations used in the process. (3) Reflections about their usage of ChatGPT.


Explanation of the Process

The requirement specification milestone is the first of 6 milestones students have to complete throughout the 3-month duration of the course. The remaining 5 milestones are design, minimum viable product (MVP), code review, testing, and final release. Although the use of assistive AI technology is allowed and encouraged throughout the course, each milestone specification is designed to ensure that students critically think and analyze their work.

For the requirement specification milestone, students, as a group of four, are initially required to come up with two project ideas that can be implemented during the course. This resulted in a total of 44 project ideas from 22 groups. As two of the groups opted out of inclusion in this study, we base the rest of this work considering the 20 remaining groups. These 20 groups are divided into two classes of 10 groups each. For the first class of groups, we label the first idea from their submission as P and second as P’, for the second class of groups we label their first idea as P’ and their second as P. This is done to ensure that neither P or P’ corresponds to the idea that the students implicitly prefer, as this can potentially be correlated with the order they present their ideas. At the end of this process, each group will have two ideas P and P’.

Subsequently, in a 2-hour long lab session, students were required to submit the formal requirement specifications for their idea P using the format specified in the <appendix / lecture material>. In this session, the students were prohibited from using any assistive AI technology and their use of smart devices were strictly monitored by TAs. At the end of the period, students submit either a scanned or a digital version of their requirement specifications. 

For the final stage of the requirement milestone, students are required to submit the formal requirement specifications for both of their ideas (P and P’) after consulting with ChatGPT, and performing a series of refinements. For idea P, students were instructed to start with their initial requirement specification from the lab, or a version refined without the use of assistive AI technology, referred to as P_initial_specs, and consult with ChatGPT to make further refinements. In contrast, for idea P’, students were instructed to directly interact with chatGPT to produce their requirement specifications. In both cases, students are allowed to perform any additional manual refinements to the specifications suggested  by ChatGPT. Figure X shows a summary of the two processes.
