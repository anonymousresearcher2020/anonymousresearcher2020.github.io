### Hey, ChatGPT, Look at My Work: Using Conversational AI in Requirements Engineering

---

This paper reports on the results of our experience integrating a conversational AI agent, namely ChatGPT, into a project-based upper-level undergraduate course on Software Engineering. For the course, 20 groups of four students each were asked to design and implement their project of choice, with an Android-based mobile client and a Node.js-based cloud server. Students were allowed to use ChatGPT at any stage of their project, albeit in a controlled way, to fulfill the educational objectives of the course. 

We specifically focus on the first phase of the project development: scoping the work and defining the project requirements. Our experience shows that students can achieve comparable results using a variety of ChatGPT interaction modes and the success of a mode largely depends on students’ preferences and learning styles. We also device a set of attribute and a quantitative metric for assessing the quality of ChatGPT prompts for this (and similar) tasks and assess the effort required to craft a high-quality prompt. Our results show that, with moderate effort, students can produce artifacts of around 80% quality level; moving to the 90% and above range requires substantial effort and investment in brainstorming and initial requirement specification drafts, crafting high-quality prompts, and critically assessing ChatGPT’s output.
