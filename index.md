### Hey, ChatGPT, Look at MyWork: Using Conversational AI in Requirements Engineering Education

---

This paper reports on our experience integrating a conversational AI agent, namely ChatGPT, into a project-based upper-level undergraduate course on Software Engineering. For the course, 20 groups of four students each were asked to design and implement their project of choice, with an Android-based mobile client and a Node.js-based cloud server. Students were allowed to use ChatGPT at any stage of their project, albeit in a controlled way, to fulfill the educational objectives of the course. 

We specifically focus on the first phase of the project development: scoping the work and defining the project requirements. Our experience shows that students can achieve comparable results using a variety of ChatGPT interaction modes and the success of a mode largely depends on students’ preferences and learning styles. We also devise a set of attributes and a quantitative metric for assessing the quality of ChatGPT prompts for this kind of tasks and assess the effort required to craft a high-quality prompt. 

Our results show that our prompt assessment metric correlates well with the quality of the result produced by ChatGPT and that crafting high-quality prompts requires a substantial investment of time. In fact, with moderate effort, students can produce artifacts of around 80% quality level; moving to the 90% and above range requires substantial effort and investment, which can be spent in brainstorming and initial requirement specification drafts or in crafting high-quality prompts and critically assessing ChatGPT’s output. We also observed that while all students perceive ChatGPT as a useful tool for ideation, refinement, and formal writing, the preferred form of interaction with the tool largely depends on students’ personal preferences and learning styles. We hope that our experience and lessons learned will spark further discussions on the role of Generative AI in both software engineering education and work practices.
