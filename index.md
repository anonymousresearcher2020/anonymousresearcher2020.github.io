### Hey, ChatGPT, Look at MyWork: Using Conversational AI in Requirements Engineering Education

---

This paper reports on our experience integrating a conversational AI agent, namely ChatGPT, into a project-based upper-level undergraduate course on Software Engineering. For the course, 20 groups of four students each were asked to design and implement their project of choice, with an Android-based mobile client and a Node.js-based cloud server. Students were allowed to use ChatGPT at any stage of their project, albeit in a controlled way, to fulfill the
educational objectives of the course.

We specifically focus on the first phase of the project development: scoping the work and defining the project requirements. Our experience shows that students can achieve comparable results using a variety of ChatGPT interaction modes and the success of a mode largely depends on students’ preferences, learning styles, and the invested effort. Yet, in any of the modes, with moderate effort students can produce artifacts of around 80% quality level; moving above this range requires substantial investment, which can be spent in brainstorming, initial requirement specification drafts, crafting high-quality prompts, or critically assessing ChatGPT’s output. We also observed that while all students perceive ChatGPT as a useful tool for ideation, refinement, and formal writing, refinement and rewriting are the most useful ChatGPT usage modes, especially for students with at least partially formed initial ideas. We hope that our experience and lessons learned will be useful and will spark further discussions on the role of Generative AI in both software engineering education and work practices.

This website provides additional information about the course setup in general and the requirements milestone in particular. It also includes the details about our requirements and prompt assessment metrics. Finally, it provides additional supporting data for each research question. We hope this information will enable reproducibility and will inspire further research in this area.
