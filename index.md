### Hey, ChatGPT, Look at MyWork: Using Conversational AI in Requirements Engineering Education

---

The emergence of conversational AI tools in late 2022 practically changed the face of software engineering and software engineering education. Contemplating the question of how to best prepare and evaluate students in this new reality, we experimented with systematically introducing a conversational AI tool, ChatGPT, into the 2023 offering of an upper-level undergraduate project-based course on Software Engineering. In this course, 20 groups of four students each had to design and implement a project of their choice, with an Android-based mobile client and a Node.js-based cloud server. This paper discusses our goals, approach, and lessons learned from introducing ChatGPT into the first phase of the project development: scoping the work and defining the project requirements.

Our experience shows that students can achieve comparable results using a variety of ChatGPT interaction modes and the success of each mode largely depends on students’ preferences, learning styles, and the invested effort. Yet, in any of the modes, with moderate effort, students can produce artifacts of a mid-range quality level of around 80%. Moving above this range requires substantial investment, which can be spent on brainstorming, crafting high-quality prompts, or critically assessing ChatGPT’s output. We also observe low prompting proficiency of the students: students can improve their prompting strategies by providing a more adequate description of their course and project setup, examples, and expected output format for their requests. Interestingly, students can often be “swayed” by ChatGPT’s projected confidence, even when their original ideas are, in fact, more appropriate than the proposed refinements. We hope that our experience and lessons learned will help spark further discussions on how to best embed AI tools into the software engineering curriculum and work practices.

This website provides additional information about the course setup in general and the requirements milestone in particular. It also includes the details about our requirements and prompt assessment metrics. Finally, it provides additional supporting data for each research question. We hope this information will enable reproducibility and will inspire further research in this area.
