### Hey, ChatGPT, Look at My Work: Using Conversational AI in Requirements Engineering

---

This paper reports on the results of our experience integrating a conversational AI agent, namely ChatGPT, into a project-based upper-level undergraduate course on Software Engineering. For the course, 20 groups of four students each were asked to design and implement their project of choice, with an Android-based mobile client and a Node-JS-based cloud server. Students were allowed to use ChatGPT at any stage of their project, albeit in a controlled way, to fulfill the educational objectives of the course. In our analysis, we focus on the first phase of the project development: scoping the work and defining the project requirements.

Our experience shows that students can achieve comparable results using a variety of ChatGPT interaction modes and the success of a mode largely depends on students’ preferences and learning styles. Yet, effort is needed to achieve high-quality results in any of the modes. This effort comes from investment in brainstorming and initial requirement specification drafts, crafting high-quality prompts, and critically assessing ChatGPT’s output. We also systematically derive criteria for crafting good prompts and contribute a quality metric that is based on this criteria. We show that the metric strongly correlates with the quality of the result produced by ChatGPT and empirically estimate the effort needed to craft high-quality prompts. We hope that our observations, lessons learned, the guidelines we provide for efficient prompt engineering, and our course experience and setup will inspire the next generation of students and professionals in effectively utilizing Conversational AI techniques in their work.
